        <p><strong>1. Load the women data from the datasets package and assign it to a variable called "women". You will have a data frame containing the height (inches) and weight (pounds) of 15 women.</strong></p>

<p>a. Convert height to m and weight into kg using mathematical operations. Do this by creating new variables height_m and weight_kg, rounding both to 2 decimals. Note: 1 inch = 0.0254 m and 1 pound = 0.454 kg.</p>

<p>b. Calculate BMI from these newly created variables, to 2 decimal places, and then bind this to the women data frame. Note: BMI = weight(kg)/(height(m)^2). Modify this equation to calculate using your variables.</p>

<p>c. What is the mean weight in kg among this sample of women?</p>

<p>d. How many women have a weight in kg that is less than the mean of this sample?</p>

<p>e. Create a new variable called "BMI_f" for the BMI factor levels. You will need to use logical operations here. </p>

<pre><code>        Low &lt; 18
        Healthy 18 - 24.99
        Overweight 25 - 29.99
        Obese &gt;= 30
</code></pre>

<p>How many women are considered healthy in this dataset? </p>

<p><strong>2. Load the file called <code>DASS_21.csv</code> into your R environment. You will have a data frame containing the raw results of DASS-21 questionnaire completed by 10 people.</strong></p>

<p>a. Using the DASS-21 handout, find the Depression score for each individual. What is the average depression score (HINT: use <code>rowSums</code> function)?</p>

<p>b. Find the Anxiety score for each individual. What is the average anxiety score?</p>

<p>c. Find the Stress score for each individual. What is the average stress score?</p>

<p>d. Find the total DASS score. Find the average for males and females, respectively. (HINT: use a logical function and index)</p>

<p>e. Create a boxplot for total DASS in males versus females. Is there a difference? (HINT: use code in workshop)</p>
