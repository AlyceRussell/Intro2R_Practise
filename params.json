You will have a data frame containing the height (inches) and weight (pounds) of 15 women.**\r\n\r\na. Convert height to m and weight into kg using mathematical operations. Do this by creating new variables height_m and weight_kg, rounding both to 2 decimals. Note: 1 inch = 0.0254 m and 1 pound = 0.454 kg.\r\n    \r\n    \r\nb. Calculate BMI from these newly created variables, to 2 decimal places, and then bind this to the women data frame. Note: BMI = weight(kg)/(height(m)^2). Modify this equation to calculate using your variables.\r\n    \r\n    \r\nc. What is the mean weight in kg among this sample of women?\r\n  \r\n\r\nd. How many women have a weight in kg that is less than the mean of this sample?\r\n   \r\n   \r\ne. Create a new variable called \"BMI_f\" for the BMI factor levels. You will need to use logical operations here. \r\n           \r\n            Low < 18\r\n            Healthy 18 - 24.99\r\n            Overweight 25 - 29.99\r\n            Obese >= 30\r\n            \r\nHow many women are considered healthy in this dataset? \r\n             \r\n\r\n**2. Load the file called `DASS_21.csv` into your R environment. You will have a data frame containing the raw results of DASS-21 questionnaire completed by 10 people.**\r\n\r\n\r\na. Using the DASS-21 handout, find the Depression score for each individual. What is the average depression score (HINT: use `rowSums` function)?\r\n    \r\n    \r\nb. Find the Anxiety score for each individual. What is the average anxiety score?\r\n   \r\n    \r\nc. Find the Stress score for each individual. What is the average stress score?\r\n   \r\n    \r\nd. Find the total DASS score. Find the average for males and females, respectively. (HINT: use a logical function and index)\r\n   \r\n    \r\ne. Create a boxplot for total DASS in males versus females. Is there a difference? (HINT: use code in workshop)\r\n    ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
